                            average, African countries are losing 2–5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and many
                            are diverting up to 9 percent of their budgets responding to climate extremes. In
                            sub-Saharan Africa, the cost of adaptation is estimated to be between US$ 30-50 billion
                            annually over the next decade, or 2-3 percent of the region's Gross Domestic Product, says
                            the WMO State of the Climate in Africa 2023 report.

                            By 2030, it is estimated that up to 118 million extremely poor people (living on less than
                            US$ 1.90 per day) will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa, if adequate
                            response measures are not put in place. This will place additional burdens on poverty
                            alleviation efforts and significantly hamper growth, according to figures cited in the
                            report. Government leaders and scientists have sounded the alarm at the accelerating scale
                            and speed of melting snow, ice and glaciers and the looming threat for human, environmental
                            and economic well-being and security.

                            The stock market rally showed mixed action last week. The Dow Jones hit a record high while
                            the S&P 500 edged higher and Russell 2000 edged lower. The Nasdaq composite lagged, as
                            Nvidia (NVDA) earnings failed to impress. But the tech-heavy composite did recover its

                        </CENTER>
                        <p>Suspendisse potenti. Duis vehicula magna id purus gravida, nec auctor dui dignissim.Period
                            effects of economic trends on fertility are usually investigated by linking the total
                            fertility rate (TFR, which represents the number of children that would be born to a woman
                            if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance
                            with current age-specific fertility rates) to macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP and
                            unemployment rate). The relationship between TFR and GDP is ambiguous. Several studies
                            (e.g., Martin, 2004) find a pro-cyclical relationship between economic growth and fertility
                            in the developed world. Fertility decline during economic recessions are seen as a result of
                            childbearing postponement, especially of first births, which can later be largely
                            compensated during times of economic prosperity. Similar arguments can be found in Kohler et
                            al. (2002a), Mills and Blossfeld (2005) and Sobotka et al. (2010), who maintain that an
                            economic downturn brings about uncertainties that in turn, lead to postponement. Other
                            studies, however, find contrasting results. Butz and Ward (1979) suggest that economic
                            upswings bring about the increased employment of women, making children more expensive
                            during times of economic prosperity. Therefore, fertility trends are likely to be
                            countercyclical (Macunovich, 1996). The negative relationship between economic growth and
                            postponement also seems to be contradicted by some recent studies (Billingsley, 2010; Aassve
                            et al., 2006).

                            A related approach that has recently received great attention is the one that explains
                            fertility patterns and cross-country fertility differences in terms of socioeconomic
                            development. Myrskylä et al. (2009) provide evidence for a fundamental change in the
                            well-established negative relationship between fertility and development. They find that
                            while low and medium levels of the Human Development Index (HDI) are associated with
                            persistent low fertility, higher HDI levels seem to promote fertility, reversing the
                            declining pattern.</p>

                            in suits follow Felipe Lopez everywhere he goes. Felipe lives in Mott Haven, in the South
                            Bronx. He is a junior at Rice High School, which is on the corner of 124th Street and Lenox
                            Avenue, in Harlem, and he plays guard for the school basketball team, the Rice Raiders. The
                            white men are ubiquitous. They rarely miss one of Felipe's games or tournaments. They have
                            absolute recall of his best minutes of play. They are authorities on his physical condition.
                            They admire his feet, which are big and pontoon-shaped, and his wrists, which have a loose,
                            silky motion. Not long ago, I sat with the white men at a game between Rice and All Hallows
                            High School. My halftime entertainment was listening to a debate between two of them -- a
                            college scout and a Westchester contractor who is a high-school basketball fan -- about
                            whether Felipe had grown a half inch over Christmas break. "I know this kid," the scout said
                            as the second half started. "A half inch is not something I would miss." The white men
                            believe that Felipe is the best high-school basketball player in the country. .</p>

                            The observations of few other scientific enterprises are as vital or affect as many people
                            as those related to weather forecasting. From the days when early humans ventured from caves
                            and other natural shelters, perceptive individuals in all likelihood became leaders by being
                            able to detect nature’s signs of impending snow, rain, or wind, indeed of any change in
                            weather. With such information they must have enjoyed greater success in the search for food
                            and safety, the major objectives of that time.

                            In a sense, weather forecasting is still carried out in basically the same way as it was by
                            the earliest humans—namely, by making observations and predicting changes. The modern tools
                            used to measure temperature, pressure, wind, and humidity in the 21st century would
                            certainly amaze them, and the results obviously are better. Yet, even the most sophisticated
                            numerically calculated forecast made on a supercomputer requires a set of measurements of
                            the condition of the atmosphere—an initial picture of temperature, wind, and other basic
                            elements, somewhat comparable to that formed by our forebears when they looked out of their
                            cave dwellings. The primeval approach entailed insights based on the accumulated experience
                            of the perceptive observer, while the modern technique consists of solving equations.
                            Although seemingly quite different, there are underlying similarities between both
                            practices. In each case the forecaster asks “What is?” in the sense of “What kind of weather
                            prevails today?” and then seeks to determine how it will change in order to extrapolate what
                            it will be.

                            Because observations are so critical to weather prediction, an account of meteorological
                            measurements
